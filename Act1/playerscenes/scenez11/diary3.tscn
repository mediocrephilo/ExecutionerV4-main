	Father came today! I'm so excited that my hands are shaking! He told me I would be leaving today, that someone would come take me far away! But why couldn't he just take me with him? I want to get out as soon as possible. It's cold and dirty, and I'm scared because sometimes I can hear screaming at night. But . . . somehow I feel like father's hiding something from me because . . . he was crying again."
