do not go gentle into that good light
turn off the night-light the firefly lights
and the streetlights at the end of all things
we were impervious

we dreamed in shouts and screams of elation no words needed
we were raw feeling bundled up into one party one mind
we bled blood red and laughed with our souls wide open
our eyes wide shut we ran mindlessly calloused soles pounding the floor and we ask you now
remember remember our deeds and our deaths
remember what we did
and that we, thereby you, truly did live once

we remember
pounding shoes and heavy breaths
thrills and chills from not knowing we dared not to linger at cliffs
to look down at jagged knives of sand and rust
we played the piano smashing keys in cacophonous harmony
melon slipping down our chins in rivulets of sticky red
storms that swept over steel clanging harsh melodic sweet brash
we were huddled under blankets ten to one sheet
stomachs growling always hungry 
donning masks of courage that cracked at cackling bursting brightness
and grinning in terrified silence
but we were free and then we crawled to safety
beyond the cliff content in blindness
