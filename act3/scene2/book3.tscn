	Asia: Because of this many western countries did not develop as many technologies as quick as they did when the trade routes from China and India were open. Also China does not exist as one country since the Mongols never unified it, and to this day it is still split in two. (not important but i need to use my history knowledge for something) Imperialism also started much later, as there were no large connections between nations of the east and west so they developed separately and China never went through a “cultural revolution”. Because of this, they retained many traditional texts and ancient palace exam answers blah blah causing inspiration and innovation. India never became a British colony since Britain was more focused on the new lands of North America. Thus, they did not suffer as much cultural erasion and rulers eventually split it into five different countries that were allied with the two parts of China. China expanded and engulfed most of Southeast Asia and Korea never gained independence. Although Chinese government communist, they held on to their isolationist policies and viewed Westerners as “the enemy”. But many countries in Southeast Asia wanted to trade and interact with western countries and disrest occurred when the Southern Chinese government began taxing them during a famine. 
Africa: However, once it began, because of the Industrial revolutions and military developments, it was even more intense and concentrated, leading to widespread rebellion and countries especially in Africa banding together to resist the Europeans, since there was no attempt at diplomacy most countries were eager to ally and defeat the Europeans. Thus, countries other than Ethiopia survived the scramble for Africa and flourished, leading certain areas of Africa to develop similar to the Americas. Of course, conquered countries were brutally treated and this division in socioeconomic status within the continent drove a rift between the citizens (relevant later). Europeans focused more on expanding in the Americas since people suck and they still saw the “uncultivated” lands of the new world as unclaimed and free for the taking.
North and South America: The fact that there were less wars over trade routes between countries led to more focus being put upon the North and South American colonies. Thus, many colonies did not gain independence until much later. The US never gained independence. Some countries in South America benefited from the introduction of technology and infrastructure that came with English and Spanish settlers, but there was still a mass erasure of culture and language so many native languages were lost forever. Erasure and unification of culture swept over the Americas, leading to unrest and boiling political tension. 
Europe: Because the Mongols did not pressure the migration of Turks in Anatolia, the Ottoman Empire did not have a driving force to exist since the position of the Seljuk Turks was relatively stable. This led to the Byzantine empire lasting far longer than it should have, but it also was not as prosperous since there was no major trading route to bring goods. Italy specifically Venice also suffered from the lack of the Silk Road and spice trade. The Byzantine empire actually spread to invade the Holy Roman Empire since there were a lack of enemies since the Ottoman Empire basically didn’t exist. This unified many major countries that would exist later like England and France, leading to decreased tension between them and eliminating many wars they would fight. They became allied later and expanded, later unified in to one country by a political marriage. Conquered most of Europe after increasing dissatisfaction with lack of funds in other countries (since many trade routes had been nonexistent). Coupled with the colonies they possessed in North America, (US split into two different colonies west and east. East is English and West is French), they quickly became the major power of the Western Hemisphere.

Wars: There were three major world wars, the first was between Eastern and Western hemispheres. The excuse was that a diplomat from North China had been negotiating terms for a territorial agreement when some European country launched a direct assassination on him and his family, intending to claim a large part of Russia for themselves. Of course, most of this was propaganda intended to garner hatred for the British/French empire. This dragged in the five countries of India as well as the European colonies to the west. Russia, which had been mainly uninhabited and split up due to the lack of Mongols, was a third party who wanted to watch the two sides fight it out and take them both out at once to ensure their independence. Mass casualties and hatred grew on both sides, further driving the isolation of the hemispheres. The war ended when the original cause of it was forgotten and both sides had suffered too many casualties to continue. This set back the progress of humanity in the areas of science, art, and philosophy by centuries, as bombs and fighting had leveled many national treasures and historical texts. Knowledge was lost and for a while people returned to a mainly agricultural, subsistence lifestyle.

Second world war occurred about a hundred years later, mirrored the actual WW2, and even more intense as the first WW had decimated the economy of most nations.

Third was what threatened nuclear fallout. Two sides were the massive, now controlling power of the West, Britance or some stupid name. Other side was the Russia-Japanese alliance, as China had all but collapsed after WW1 and the ones who stayed mostly neutral took this advantage to conquer and destroy most Chinese government. Sinorus. Uhhhhhhhh nuclear fallout mass accumulation of warheads from both sides, like the cold war but worse because people are desensitized to warfare now with the development of WMDs and full coverage of any smaller wars that go on. Government covers these wars to desensitize people and prepare them for a final takeover by one hemisphere or the other. Instead of focusing on curing disease taxes and funding go to formulating drugs that empower the human body, often with horrible side effects. Not feeling pain, not needing to sleep, soldiers driven to insanity. Citizens increasingly dissatisfied and the Britannica empire fricken accidentally plans a military demonstration too close to the shores of japan and they take it as a sign of imminent invasion and fire the warheads, sparking all out nuclear fallout. By this time, radiation was not much of an issue since humans had adapted due to the destruction of the ozone layer and also the development of the drugs. Also underground bunkers happened and for the next couple centuries most civilization was underground. 

Made up history: The Eali Regime came into power during a period of chaos and political conflict within the underground region of North/South America. Fighting for resources like uncontaminated water as well as light sources for growing plants, one faction rose because they adopted and improved military strategies of the past found in the ruins of a library they came across while exploring topside. Although, they specialized mostly in psychological warfare, putting up a peaceful front and causing most people to support them. However, the carefully crafted propaganda and staged fights and riots were reflective of their true, cruel, policies. They even manufactured disasters like droughts and famines, to miraculously come across a huge reservoir or pile of tillable soil and share it with citizens to show their generosity. Although, they did contribute to the reclaiming of the surface by employing skilled people?? To repair infrastructure and build communication with other bunkers. After a few more decades/centuries? After the surface was mostly safe to live on again, the Eali regime emerged as a leading power in the West. This was mirrored by the Xiangju of the East, which lead historians who knew about the cause of nuclear fallout to panic. In reality, these two major powers had already agreed to ally, and were posing as enemies to incur nationalism. The Eali regime got a hold of, wait for it, I’m not even kidding, A Brave New World and thought it was a history book describing an early civilization and adopted many of its methods. The capitol city was the only city they built, in the middle of Canada, and it had most of the modern technology that was recovered after nuclear fallout. However, the majority of citizens had no knowledge of the history of the world or of technology since education had not played a role in humanity’s development ever since the fallout. The only people who were allowed to live in the capitol were government officials, scientists, historians working to cover up and rewrite history, and other loyals to the Eali regime. Their families, however, were not allowed. They lived in modernity and luxury. The common citizen’s condition though, had reverted back to something like the middle ages. The government sectioned off land for villages, and each village was assigned about 20 people. These villages were isolated and surrounded by dangerous forest, and the government planted people to warn about the dangers of the outside and spread propaganda. Farming and agriculture was the only way of survival, and the village economy mirrored the villages of Europe in the 1600s. However, the government knew that people would eventually find out about the capitol city and get suspicious, so they planned exposure trips to openly show off the city, portraying it as a special attraction the government had created for its citizens. All transportation was now underground since the different bunkers had long been connected, and it was quick too. Electricity of course existed and it was explained by introducing Magic to the public. Magic was what made all things possible, but only certain people were born with the ability to use it. Every year the government would send people to villages to find children born with “Magic” and take them away to be “trained”. In reality, this was a way to curb the population and the villagers never heard from the children again. The special holiday created to curb curiosity occured when children reached adult age, 16, or rather the age that they are most impressionable at. These children were allowed to leave their village for three days and travel to any government sponsored attraction to play. In a rare fit of ironic humor, the historians who created this holiday named it Runspringe, misreading Rumspringa in an old text. The government initially only had City (the capitol city) as its one planned attraction, but it saw that there were too many people and too many demands to enter it, so they created attractions like Park and Pool. (Literally what they sound like. Remember they’re filled with “magic”).
 
Rebellion: Of course, no good dystopias last long, so basically what happens is the leader of the rebellion along with his little gang stumbles upon a pretty well preserved set of history textbooks. He figures out the general gist of the world w his little buddies and he’s like wait! The government is lying to us! Duh! But due to the prolific and effective propaganda no one is willing to listen to him and he’s regarded as a mentally insane person in his village.  The government gets wind of this and brings him to the Capitol, where they ask him to show them the books he found, but he refuses and is thrown in prison. Later, some scientists and historians who secretly disagree w the government find him and he shares his knowledge with them and they conduct experiments and restore more technology secretly, without introducing it to the government. He gradually gets more and more followers within the capitol, and the government, who of course had known about this for a long time decide it’s finally time to put him down. However, they miscalculate, as his group who have been looking for him outside arrive and agree to be tested upon by the scientists who have developed a Super Serum like in the Marvel comics, which is where they got it from because that was one of the books he got back. I’m literally so serious. These people begin to gather support within the capitol and after demonstrations of strength and taking bullets from the military without dying, many more people join their side. The government is panicking now, but its reached a point where the people in charge don’t know what to do since it’s the first rebellion they’ve dealt with and all the history books have long been rewritten. Eventually the rebellion succeeds. However, he ends up disappearing mysteriously no one knows what happens. Only people from the Eali regime know that the last order the old government gave was to capture and torture the rebellion leader to death. You, the mc, got assigned to the task as part of an assassination squad. You manage to capture him and kill him. His body is never discovered. His disappearance is regarded as a sign of divinity, that he was the savior and the sacrificial lamb blah blah of course no religion survived but the concept isn’t foreign, and, I’m so sorry I have to, he becomes the face of a new religion that sprouts up with the encouragement of the new regime. No one outside the capitol knows about anything yet, which brings us to the first girl’s diary.

text = "ion of the Seljuk Turks was relatively stable. This led to the Byzantine empire lasting far longer than it should have, but it also was not as prosperous since there was no major trading route to bring goods. Italy specifically Venice also suffered from the lack of the Silk Road and spice trade. The Byzantine empire actually spread to invade the Holy Roman Empire since there were a lack of enemies since the Ottoman Empire basically didn’t exist. This unified many major countries that would exist later like England and France, leading to decreased tension between them and eliminating many wars they would fight. They became allied later and expanded, later unified in to one country by a political marriage. Conquered most of Europe after increasing dissatisfaction with lack of funds in other countries (since many trade routes had been nonexistent). Coupled with the colonies they possessed in North America, (US split into two different colonies west and east. East is English and West is French), they quickly became the major power of the Western Hemisphere.

Wars: There were three major world wars, the first was between Eastern and Western hemispheres. The excuse was that a diplomat from North China had been negotiating terms for a territorial agreement when some European country launched a direct assassination on him and his family, intending to claim a large part of Russia for themselves. Of course, most of this was propaganda intended to garner hatred for the British/French empire. This dragged in the five countries of India as well as the European colonies to the west. Russia, which had been mainly uninhabited and split up due to the lack of Mongols, was a third party who wanted to watch the two sides fight it out and take them both out at once to ensure their independence. Mass casualties and hatred grew on both sides, further driving the isolation of the hemispheres. The war ended when the original cause of it was forgotten and both sides had suffered too many casualties to continue. This set back the progress of humanity in the areas of science, art, and philosophy by centuries, as bombs and fighting had leveled many national treasures and historical texts. Knowledge was lost and for a while people returned to a mainly agricultural, subsistence lifestyle.

Second world war occurred about a hundred years later, mirrored the actual WW2, and even more intense as the first WW had decimated the economy of most nations.

Third was what threatened nuclear fallout. Two sides were the massive, now controlling power of the West, Britance or some stupid name. Other side was the Russia-Japanese alliance, as China had all but collapsed after WW1 and the ones who stayed mostly neutral took this advantage to conquer and destroy most Chinese government. Sinorus. Uhhhhhhhh nuclear fallout mass accumulation of warheads from both sides, like the cold war but worse because people are desensitized to warfare now with the development of WMDs and full coverage of any smaller wars that go on. Government covers these wars to desensitize people and prepare them for a final takeover by one hemisphere or the other. Instead of focusing on curing disease taxes and funding go to formulating drugs that empower the human body, often with horrible side effects. Not feeling pain, not needing to sleep, soldiers driven to insanity. Citizens increasingly dissatisfied and the Britannica empire fricken accidentally plans a military demonstration too close to the shores of japan and they take it as a sign of imminent invasion and fire the warheads, sparking all out nuclear fallout. By this time, radiation was not much of an issue since humans had adapted due to the destruction of the ozone layer and also the development of the drugs. Also underground bunkers happened and for the next couple centuries most civilization was underground. 

Made up history: The Eali Regime came into power during a period of chaos and political conflict within the underground region of North/South America. Fighting for resources like uncontaminated water as well as light sources for growing plants, one faction rose because they adopted and improved military strategies of the past found in the ruins of a library they came across while exploring topside. Although, they specialized mostly in psychological warfare, putting up a peaceful front and causing most people to support them. However, the carefully crafted propaganda and staged fights and riots were reflective of their true, cruel, policies. They even manufactured disasters like droughts and famines, to miraculously come across a huge reservoir or pile of tillable soil and share it with citizens to show their generosity. Although, they did contribute to the reclaiming of the surface by employing skilled people?? To repair infrastructure and build communication with other bunkers. After a few more decades/centuries? After the surface was mostly safe to live on again, the Eali regime emerged as a leading power in the West. This was mirrored by the Xiangju of the East, which lead historians who knew about the cause of nuclear fallout to panic. In reality, these two major powers had already agreed to ally, and were posing as enemies to incur nationalism. The Eali regime got a hold of, wait for it, I’m not even kidding, A Brave New World and thought it was a history book describing an early civilization and adopted many of its methods. The capitol city was the only city they built, in the middle of Canada, and it had most of the modern technology that was recovered after nuclear fallout. However, the majority of citizens had no knowledge of the history of the world or of technology since education had not played a role in humanity’s development ever since the fallout. The only people who were allowed to live in the capitol were government officials, scientists, historians working to cover up and rewrite history, and other loyals to the Eali regime. Their families, however, were not allowed. They lived in modernity and luxury. The common citizen’s condition though, had reverted back to something like the middle ages. The government sectioned off land for villages, and each village was assigned about 20 people. These villages were isolated and surrounded by dangerous forest, and the government planted people to warn about the dangers of the outside and spread propaganda. Farming and agriculture was the only way of survival, and the village economy mirrored the villages of Europe in the 1600s. However, the government knew that people would eventually find out about the capitol city and get suspicious, so they planned exposure trips to openly show off the city, portraying it as a special attraction the government had created for its citizens. All transportation was now underground since the different bunkers had long been connected, and it was quick too. Electricity of course existed and it was explained by introducing Magic to the public. Magic was what made all things possible, but only certain people were born with the ability to use it. Every year the government would send people to villages to find children born with “Magic” and take them away to be “trained”. In reality, this was a way to curb the population and the villagers never heard from the children again. The special holiday created to curb curiosity occured when children reached adult age, 16, or rather the age that they are most impressionable at. These children were allowed to leave their village for three days and travel to any government sponsored attraction to play. In a rare fit of ironic humor, the historians who created this holiday named it Runspringe, misreading Rumspringa in an old text. The government initially only had City (the capitol city) as its one planned attraction, but it saw that there were too many people and too many demands to enter it, so they created attractions like Park and Pool. (Literally what they sound like. Remember they’re filled with “magic”).
 
Rebellion: Of course, no good dystopias last long, so basically what happens is the leader of the rebellion along with his little gang stumbles upon a pretty well preserved set of history textbooks. He figures out the general gist of the world w his little buddies and he’s like wait! The government is lying to us! Duh! But due to the prolific and effective propaganda no one is willing to listen to him and he’s regarded as a mentally insane person in his village.  The government gets wind of this and brings him to the Capitol, where they ask him to show them the books he found, but he refuses and is thrown in prison. Later, some scientists and historians who secretly disagree w the government find him and he shares his knowledge with them and they conduct experiments and restore more technology secretly, without introducing it to the government. He gradually gets more and more followers within the capitol, and the government, who of course had known about this for a long time decide it’s finally time to put him down. However, they miscalculate, as his group who have been looking for him outside arrive and agree to be tested upon by the scientists who have developed a Super Serum like in the Marvel comics, which is where they got it from because that was one of the books he got back. I’m literally so serious. These people begin to gather support within the capitol and after demonstrations of strength and taking bullets from the military without dying, many more people join their side. The government is panicking now, but its reached a point where the people in charge don’t know what to do since it’s the first rebellion they’ve dealt with and all the history books have long been rewritten. Eventually the rebellion succeeds. However, he ends up disappearing mysteriously no one knows what happens. Only people from the Eali regime know that the last order the old government gave was to capture and torture the rebellion leader to death. You, the mc, got assigned to the task as part of an assassination squad. You manage to capture him and kill him. His body is never discovered. His disappearance is regarded as a sign of divinity, that he was the savior and the sacrificial lamb blah blah of course no religion survived but the concept isn’t foreign, and, I’m so sorry I have to, he becomes the face of a new religion that sprouts up with the encouragement of the new regime. No one outside the capitol knows about anything yet, which brings us to the first girl’s diary.
