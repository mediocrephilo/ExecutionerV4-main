we remember
pounding shoes and heavy breaths
thrills and chills from not knowing we dared not to linger at cliffs
to look down at jagged knives of sand and rust
we played the piano smashing keys in cacophonous harmony
melon slipping down our chins in rivulets of sticky red
storms that swept over steel clanging harsh melodic sweet brash
we were huddled under blankets ten to one sheet
stomachs growling always hungry 
donning masks of courage that cracked at cackling bursting brightness
and grinning in terrified silence
but we were free and then we crawled to safety
beyond the cliff content in blindness

we tore bandages off too fast (too fast!) 
to watch red spread over pale yellow skin just because we could"

	In 21XX, Councilor O’Brien raised a further problem with the lottery system, citing its inhumanity and loss of efficiency as reasons for its removal. In one of the more crucial decisions of the fourth Diplomacy, nine of twelve Council members voted in favor of adopting a new system of O’Brien’s design. The resulting documents and laws became known as the Eali Labor Force Acts, or E.L.F. In this new system, the old issues of a diminishing workforce and a wasteful use of resources were solved in one blow by combining the source of the problems. (See Topic 7.6) While it is an ongoing debate within the Bureau of Ethics, scholars agree that E.L.F is a vast improvement from the obsolete annual lottery.
	Incomplete Solutions
	It is much easier to dictate a directive than it is to implement one. Although the methods of previous leaders ensured a uniformity in beliefs,"

do not go gentle into that good light
turn off the night-light the firefly lights
and the streetlights at the end of the path
we were impervious

we dreamed in shouts and screams of elation no words needed
we were raw feeling bundled up into one party one mind
we bled blood red and laughed with our souls wide open
our eyes wide shut we ran mindlessly calloused soles pounding the floor and we ask you now
remember remember our deeds and our deaths
remember what we did
and that we, and you, truly lived once

text = ", the resulting loyalty proved incredibly inconducive towards change. (See Topic 6.5) The E.L.F. Acts served as a replacement for a status-quo, introducing a new order, a new way of thinking. The Bureau of Justice was one of the major opponents to the ratification of these Acts, as they feared a significant decrease in funding as well as political power due to the eventual elimination of the Executioner Corps. However, these fears proved to be unfounded, as the idealism of the E.L.F. Acts failed, as many do, to translate into reality. Surprisingly, the year after the ratification of the E.L.F Acts, the Executioner Corps received an increase in applications (although some suspect this surplus to be manufactured). (See Topic 10.2)"
