	It is much easier to dictate a directive than it is to implement one.

Acts served as a replacement for a status-quo, introducing a new order, a new way of thinking. The Bureau of Justice was one of the major opponents to the ratification of these Acts, as they feared a significant decrease in funding as well as political power due to the eventual elimination of the Executioner Corps. However, these fears proved to be unfounded, as the idealism of the E.L.F. Acts failed, as many do, to translate into reality. Surprisingly, the year after the ratification of the E.L.F Acts, the Executioner Corps received an increase in applications (although some suspect this surplus to be manufactured). (See Topic 10.2) "
